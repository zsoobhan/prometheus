            <p>
            I am a senior web-developer with an MSci in Astrophysics,
            specialising in the construction and maintenance of software
            solutions primarily engineered in Python. I have expertise in a
            variety of tools and frameworks such as Django, Flask, and
            CherryPy, and have over 5 years of commercial experience in
            building scalable web applications for numerous reputable global
            companies. I work with a variety of programming architectures and
            paradigms including microservices, domain driven design, and
            monolithic and distributed systems, with a skill-set that favours
            back-end development and TDD. My experience also extends to DevOps,
            as I have contributed to software architectured on a variety of
            cloud platforms such as AWS and DigitalOcean through the use of
            continuous integration systems (e.g. Jenkins and CircleCI) as well
            as more traditional, bare-metal stacks.
            </p>

            <p>
            I enjoy working as part of a team, and have a firm belief that
            code-reviews and coherent teamwork is integral to creating a
            healthy work environment conducive to successful and productive
            projects.
            </p>

            <p>
            I am both an English and a French native speaker, and am an avid
            rock climber.  When not at work, I most probably can be found at my
            local climbing wall where I train three to four times a week.
            </p>
