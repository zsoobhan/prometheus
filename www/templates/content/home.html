                <p>
                I am a web-developer with an MSci in Astrophysics as well as an avid rock-climber.
                My work involves the implementation and maintenance of solutions primarily engineered in Python and Django 
                which has lead to me being exposed to various mechanisms of content delivery. 
                I work with various web technologies such as WSGI, Nginx, Apache, VirtualEnv and am particularly
                interested in using Django as well as Docker. When not at work, I most probably can be found at my local
                climbing wall where I train three to four times a week.
